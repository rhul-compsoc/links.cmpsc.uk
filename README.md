# Links for CompSoc (Linktree ew)!

An easily configurable linktree equivalent for CompSoc.

## To make changes...

... Head over to the `vals.json` files, where you can add, remove, and modify values as you please.
When adding social medias, make sure to also add a corresponding svg file with their icon to `/public`.
For this project, [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) were used.

> Make sure to name the filenames _EXACTLY_ the same as the title for a social platform, all in lowercase. E.g. for `Facebook`, set the filename to `facebook.svg`.
